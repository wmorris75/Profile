              <h2>waynemorris.info</h2>
              <p>
                  waynemorris.info was built with the Ruby on Rails framework. It was a project that was developed to gain understanding of the Ruby on Rails framework and to increase my familiarity with front-end development utilizing HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery and GoogleMaps API, as well as an opportunity to highlight my skills and professional experience from various areas.

              <h2>Web Crawler System Infrastructure</h2>
              <p>
                I played a major role in supporting and maintaining the <a href="http://www.wishclouds.com" style="display:inline"> Wishclouds</a> Crawler System infrastructure which was built using Ruby. I developed new crawlers and performed various enhancements to the system which includes: 
                 <li>rewriting all the necessary queries that were to be performed using AWS DynamoDB to optimize database performance.</li>
                 <li>modifying the system so that updates were done correctly</li>
                 <li>apply fixes to any issues concerning crawler functionality</li>
                 <li>developed solutions for extracting accurate information when scraping difficult web pages</li>
                 <li>and working with Redis, Elasticsearch and MongoDB to store and perform CRUD operations as necessary.</li>
              </p>
